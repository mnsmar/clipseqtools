Analyses:

*** 1 sample

counts
	
	genomic element totals (repeats, genes, noncoding etc)
	introns/exons
	genes/transcripts (total / exons)
		normalization (quartile, rpkm)
	UTR,CDS (total / exons)

	notes: maybe we can add the option to filter by a list of genes/transcripts

location

	on exons (bins)
	on genes (bins)
	on elements / locations (arbirtrary bed file)
	genome coverage (?)

sequence

	number of Nmers on sequence
	number of Nmers on sequence (on genes / exons etc)
	filter tags containing Nmer (list of Nmers)

*** 2 samples

counts

	compare per genomic element
	...


location

	compare loc on exons
	...

sequence

	Nmer comparison
	Nmer (genes / exons etc) comparison
	

-----------------------------------------------

Issues:

* simplify input (driver, host etc) since we know which db will be used
* standardize flags
* speed
* using NO custom files
* using as FEW external files (gtf etc)
