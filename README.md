# CLIPSeqTools


## Summary
CLIPSeqTools is a collection of scripts that can be used for the analysis of CLIP-Seq data.
The toolbox is primarily oriented for bioinfromaticians but we try to make it a simple as possible so that even biologists with a little bit of command line background could run most of the analysis.
