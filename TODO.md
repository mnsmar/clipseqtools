# Data management

## Database import
* DONE - Import SAM to database

## Annotation
* DONE - Annotate with transcript/genic info
* DONE - Annotate with RMSK
* TODO - Annotate with T->C mutations
* TODO - Annotate with mismatches/deletions


# Analyses

## Per library

* DONE - Distribution on genic elements (5'UTR, CDS, 3'UTR, Introns, Exons)
* DONE - Genome coverage (percent of genome covered by library)
* DONE - Genomic distribution (percent of reads on genomic elements - 5'UTR, CDS, Exons, Repeats, etc)
* DONE - Count reads on genic elements (Genes, Transcripts, 5'UTR, CDS, 3'UTR, Introns, Exons)
* DONE - Normalize counts with Upper Quartile
* DONE - Nmer counts and enrichment

* TODO - Cluster characterization
* TODO - Cluster size distribution
* TODO - size distribution
* TODO - nucleotide preferences
* TODO - location -> on elements / locations (arbirtrary bed file)
* ???? - sequence -> filter tags containing Nmer (list of Nmers)

## Compare libraries

* DONE - Percent of overlap between two libraries.
* DONE - Read density of one library around the reads of another.
* TODO - counts -> compare per genomic element
* ???? - location -> compare loc on exons
* TODO - sequence -> Nmer comparison
* TODO - sequence -> Nmer (genes / exons etc) comparison


# Issues:

* DONE - simplify input (driver, host etc) since we know which db will be used
* DONE - standardize flags
* TO?? - speed
* TODO - use no custom files
* TODO - minimize external files usage (gtf etc)
